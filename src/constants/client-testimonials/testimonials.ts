      "I always used to think that life changing decisions are the tough ones, those that leave you pondering for quite a while and then eventually after evaluating every up- and downside of the situation end in a new way of living. But recently I realised that sometimes it’s the smallest decisions that can tremendously turn your life around and change who you are. When I made the decision to train together with Leung to pursue a healthier and more active lifestyle, I had not the slightest idea of how much Leung would influence the way I feel about training, nutrition and help me build a stronger mindset. From the very beginning he was dedicated to accomplish the personal goals we set together by designing personalised training programs and by monitoring and adjusting my dietary needs.",
      "When you choose to train with Leung you not only get a personal trainer but more importantly a companion who genuinely cares about your progress and guides you through the exercise roller coaster ride. He shares his knowledge about fitness and nutrition with pure honesty, no false promises, no false hopes, no quick fix, just a dose of reality and the tools and support to achieve what had always been in my power.",
      "Make no mistake, during the last 5 months of training with Leung I encountered some of my biggest challenges so far, but at the same time I’ve also had some of the most rewarding experiences. Who would have thought that all the struggle and sweat to deadlift more than my own bodyweight and to train my grip strength enough to enable my first non-assisted pull-ups would make me feel so delighted.",
      "I can truly say that training with Leung has not only improved my physical fitness but also helped me to grow the strength, confidence and willpower to become a better version of myself and living my best life. Thank you!",

      "Leung is a fantastic PT I would highly recommend. His sessions are varied with a great range of different exercises that are well tailored to your own goals, set to my own level but still pushing me to build strength and go further. He builds in particular exercises according to your own preferences and abilities. Leung is friendly and very knowledgeable about the impact of different exercises on your muscles, nutrition and general physical health. He has really helped me build confidence in the gym, use a huge range of new exercises and actually made it fun to go to the gym which is a huge personal leap forward as I came to him pretty inexperienced. It has been great to see so much progression and results so quickly which just keep building. I would vouch for Leung as a highly capable PT that could help individuals of all levels achieve their fitness goals.",

      "Prior to working with Leung I was training regularly but totally uninformed about the movements I was doing, how to effectively work towards my health goals and good technique.",
      "Since working with Leung I have learned so much and definitely bypassed years of trial-and-error. He’s taught me so many different exercises that I’ve been wanting to learn, but haven't had the knowledge or confidence to attempt. Leung consistently pushes me outside of my comfort zone and makes me achieve more than I think I’m capable of.",
      "Throughout the duration of our sessions I’ve always felt in safe hands and never at risk of injury. Correct technique and safety has always been a big focus of our sessions. Working through new movements that specifically target the areas of my body I want to improve, I’ve found new confidence at the gym and I’m seeing rapid changes in my physique through the work I’m putting in.",
      "When joining the gym I initially had no interest in working with a personal trainer, but I am beyond pleased with the decision to work with Leung. His friendly, personable manner really made me feel at ease from the beginning.",
      "I can confidently recommend Leung as a Personal Trainer to anyone that wants to better themselves and learn more about their training - I’ve already recommended him to many of my friends!",

      "I’d never had a PT before working with Leung, but I’m SO happy I made the decision to go for it. I leave every session feeling knackered because he works me so hard, but I also feel way more positive and energised and generally happier.",
      "With Leung’s motivation, I’m training harder and more consistently than I ever have before. It has only been a few months but I can already feel my body getting stronger which is amazing!",
      "Would totally recommend Leung to anyone who wants to work hard, see results and feel more positive!",
